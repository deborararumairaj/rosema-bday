  Blessed 20th birthday chellam!! 

  You are one incredibly intelligent, beautiful, witty and graceful young girl. One I'm beyond grateful to call my sister and bestest friend. You're my most trusted confidiant, and the person that makes me laugh the loudest. 

  As Esther, you carry yourself with the kind of courage that people can only hope to one day emulate. The kind that wavers at nothing and takes everything in stride. The kind that urges others to follow in pursuit. 

  As Rose, you blossom ever so brightly, enrapturing everyone you encounter with your charming smile and even brighter personality. You have a talent for disarming even the most guarded and uniting everyone.

  As Joy, you have brought me-and all the others you've so much as crossed paths with-so much happiness with every interaction. You truly emulate the fruit of the Holy Spirit in everything you do, may the joy of the Lord continue to be your strength. 

  As Angel, you've consistently been a bearer of good news and a fierce protector. I know I can always count on my babes to have my back, even when you have no clue whats going on--lol so many throwbacks huh! 
  
  Thank you for being a blessing to me my love. 

  May God open for you the windows of heaven, and pour out for you such blessing that there will not be enough room to receive it. May He cause His face to shine upon you, and enlarge your tent. May you never lack any good thing all the days of your life. May you bear fruits in and out of season, never perturbed by external conditions, and always securuly connected to the true vine. May nations shall come to your light, and kings to the brightness of your rising.

  It is my prayer that God continues to use you for His glory my love. May you forever be a vessel He takes pride in using.

  May this new decade usher in blessings like never before, and may this season come with more impact for the glory of God and God alone. 

  I love you more than I'll ever be able to express with my actions or words. 

  Blessed 20th my sweeting hearting :)

  Love from your DebiDebi❤️
